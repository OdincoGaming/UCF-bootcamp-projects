            <p>I came to write code and push commits, and I'm all out of commits. Ahem, in all seriousness; I have been creating mods for video games for years now
            and have even made a few games of my own! After graduating high school I went to a technical school to learn to weld, having heard all the stories about how much money
            welders can make. After a few years in the construction industry I thought to myself "I don't want to retire doing this." and so now I'm shifting my focus onto my passion
            for programming and honing my skills to become a full-stack developer.
